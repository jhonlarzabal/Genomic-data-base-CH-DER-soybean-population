This matrix contain the information generated by sequencing using BARC6K from Song et al 2020.
This is a project about resistant discovery to soybean stem canker caused by Diaporthe caulivora.
Genomic data are uploaded to the repository as a journal requirement for the publication of the paper.Anyone who justifies the need for more information can go to the journal's website and consult the supplementary files. If you do not find the necessary information, I will gladly send it to you via email.
This matrix contain the information generated by sequencing using BARC6K from Song et al 2020. ItÂ´s a matrix of 319 x 6000. The SNPs are codified A or B, when some of then has AA it means that the corresponding code to this loci is the first letter at the end of the SNP name. For example in the first SNP say 01_138835_A_G, so BB=GG
